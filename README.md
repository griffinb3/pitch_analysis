## Pitch Analysis

## Author: Griffin Brown, Daniel Patterson

## Database: 2021 Average Pitch Data, from baseballsavant.mlb.com

## Idea behind the project
With such an open ended project, we wished to write a code that provided insightful data analysis to something that we hold very close: baseball. The importance of statistics has increased as the technology in the sport has advanced, which allows us to use the data captured to provide a deeper look into the numbers. I found a dataset on baseballsavant.mlb.com, Major League Baseball's data collection website that is available to the public, containing data about every single pitcher who threw an ample number of innings throughout the course of the 2021 season. With the find of this dataset, we looked into what statistical analysis we could provide for coaches, players, organizations or ever baseball media. Looking through the data, we decided to calculate the average pitch speed per team, for each type of common pitch thrown throughout the year. Once we had our averages per team, we wanted to present the data in a fashion that could be easily compared to the end of season standings for the 2021 regular season. We determined that by being able to see what pitches were thrown at the highest velocities on average, per team, might have some correlation to how teams eneded up performing throughout the year. Of course, there are several other compounding factors that go into this, but this is a statistic as college baseball players, we were especially intrigued in.
