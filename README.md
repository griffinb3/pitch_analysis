## Idea behind the project
With such an open ended project, we wished to write a code that provided insightful data analysis to something that we hold very close: baseball. The importance of statistics has increased as the technology in the sport has advanced, which allows us to use the data captured to provide a deeper look into the numbers. I found a dataset on baseballsavant.mlb.com, Major League Baseball's data collection website that is available to the public, containing data about every single pitcher who threw an ample number of innings throughout the course of the 2021 season. With the find of this dataset, we looked into what statistical analysis we could provide for coaches, players, organizations or ever baseball media. Looking through the data, we decided to calculate the average pitch speed per team, for each type of common pitch thrown throughout the year. Once we had our averages per team, we wanted to present the data in a fashion that could be easily compared to the end of season standings for the 2021 regular season. We determined that by being able to see what pitches were thrown at the highest velocities on average, per team, might have some correlation to how teams eneded up performing throughout the year. Of course, there are several other compounding factors that go into this, but this is a statistic as college baseball players, we were especially intrigued in.

## Utilization of our Project
In the baseball world, code like this is very useful for the team statisticians. This code could be used by them to analyze what other pitchers are doing in regards to the metrics of their pitch repetoire. Some pitchers are known for certain pitches. For example, in the 2021 average pitch data, if the changeup option is selected, we will see Devin Williams pop up at the top of the list. In terms of standard deviation, his changeup is far ahead of the next best by a long shot. If coaches and analytics guys in the baseball universe were able to recreate the same metrics on a pitch (with several other factors involved), there could be many andvancements to a pitchers pitches.

Another potential usage could be for the coaching staff and front office. In the game of baseball, the higher the velocity a pitcher is able to throw pitches at, the better the pitch will be, especially in regards to the fastball. If front offices were able to identify players who were free agents or players looking to be traded that could increase their teams average pitch velocity, that may be very advantageous to creating a well-equiped pitching staff. There is always room for 'specialty' arms in the bullpen. Guys who were designed to face a select few batters, who have known weaknesses. The more guys that a front office is able to sign that have this unique ability, the better off the team could be.
